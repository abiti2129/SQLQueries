Queries that were excuted to work on Rockbuster Film Rentals Data Set

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world; however, with the emergence of online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, management wants to launch an online rental service to stay competitive.  
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

By performing data querying in SQL, using Excel, creating a data dictionary, and creating visualizations in Tableau, results were presented in a concise report with actionable insights. Based on this feedback, stakeholders are able to create a competitive marketing strategy for repositioning their business to an online platform.
